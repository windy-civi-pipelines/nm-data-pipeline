10 services that are not described in this section. The
11 superintendent shall establish by rule a minimum interval

5 "59A-18-16.2. HEALTH INSURANCE OR HEALTH PLAN FORM AND
6 RATE FILINGS--SUPERINTENDENT--RULEMAKING--COMPLIANCE WITH
7 FEDERAL LAW.--
8 A. A small group health plan and a health
9 insurance issuer or multiple employer welfare arrangement
10 offering a small group or individual health insurance plan
11 that provides benefits other than excepted benefits shall:
12 (1) provide the essential health benefits
13 defined by the superintendent under Subsection B of this
14 section;
15 (2) limit cost sharing for such coverage in
16 accordance with Subsection D of this section; and
17 (3) provide coverage without cost sharing
18 for preventive benefits in accordance with Subsection E of
19 this section.
20 B. The superintendent shall define by rule the
21 essential health benefits package to include at least the
22 following general categories and the items and services
23 covered within the categories:
24 (1) ambulatory patient services;
25 (2) emergency services; SB 3

13 C. In defining the essential health benefits
14 pursuant to Subsection B of this section, the superintendent
15 shall:
16 (1) ensure that such essential health
17 benefits reflect an appropriate balance among the categories
18 described in that subsection, so that benefits are not unduly
19 weighted toward any category;
20 (2) not make coverage decisions, determine
21 reimbursement rates, establish incentive programs or design
22 benefits in ways that discriminate against individuals
23 because of their age, disability or expected length of life;
24 (3) take into account the health care needs
25 of diverse segments of the population, including women, SB 3
Page 24

1 children, persons with disabilities and other groups;
2 (4) ensure that health benefits established

4 their wishes on the basis of the individual's age or expected
5 length of life or of the individual's present or predicted
6 disability, degree of medical dependency or quality of life;
7 (5) provide that if a plan is offered
8 through the New Mexico health insurance exchange, another
9 health insurance plan offered through the New Mexico health
10 insurance exchange shall not fail to be treated as a

12 coverage of benefits offered through the standalone plan that
13 are otherwise required; and
14 (6) periodically update the essential health
15 benefits under Subsection B of this section to address any
16 gaps in access to coverage or changes in the evidence base

20 shall not establish a restricted lifetime or annual limit on
21 the dollar value of benefits for any participant or
22 beneficiary with respect to benefits that are essential
23 health benefits, as determined by the superintendent. The
24 provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to
25 prevent a group health plan or health insurance plan from SB 3
Page 25

1 placing annual or lifetime per-beneficiary limits on specific
2 covered benefits that are not essential health benefits, to
3 the extent that these limits are otherwise permitted under
4 federal or state law.
5 E. The superintendent shall adopt and promulgate
6 rules specifying the maximum cost-sharing amounts for which
7 an insured may be held liable for payment of covered benefits

10 copayments or similar charge, and any other expenditure
11 required of an insured individual with respect to essential

13 premiums, balance billing amounts for non-network providers
14 or spending for non-covered services.
15 F. Any rules that the office of superintendent of
16 insurance intends to adopt and promulgate pursuant to this
17 section shall be adopted no later than the first day of
18 February of the year prior to the first plan year for which

1 rating of "A" or "B" in the current recommendations of the
2 United States preventive services task force;

15 Paragraph (1) of this subsection, as provided for in
16 comprehensive guidelines supported by the health resources
17 and services administration of the United States department

19 H. The provisions of Subsection G of this section
20 shall not be construed to prohibit a health insurance plan or
21 health insurance issuer from providing coverage for services
22 in addition to those recommended by the United States
23 preventive services task force or to deny coverage for
24 services that are not described in this section. The
25 superintendent shall establish by rule a minimum interval SB 3

2 Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Subsection G of this section or a
3 guideline under Paragraph (3) of Subsection G of this section
4 is issued and the plan year with respect to which the
5 requirement described in Subsection G of this section is
6 effective with respect to the service described in such
7 recommendation or guideline; provided that the interval shall
8 not be less than one year from the date the federal
9 recommendation or guideline is published.
10 I. If a health insurance plan is offered as a
11 qualified health plan through the New Mexico health insurance
12 exchange, the insurer offering the qualified health plan
13 shall also offer that plan through the health insurance
14 exchange as a plan that restricts enrollment to individuals
15 who, as of the beginning of a plan year, have not attained
16 the age of twenty-one years.
17 J. The superintendent shall adopt rules:
18 (1) to define terms used regarding forms,

3 appropriate to carry out the provisions of Chapter 59A,
4 Article 18 NMSA 1978.
5 K. Except as provided by state or federal rule or
6 law, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a
7 health insurance carrier from appropriately using reasonable
