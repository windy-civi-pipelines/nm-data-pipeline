E. A person who commits abuse of a child that does not result in the child's death or great bodily harm is, for a first offense, guilty of a third degree felony and for second and subsequent offenses is guilty of a second degree felony.

D. The taking of a newborn child into temporary protective custody under this section shall not be deemed an arrest, nor shall it constitute a police record. E.
