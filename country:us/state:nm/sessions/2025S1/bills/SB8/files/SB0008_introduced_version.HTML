advisory board and based on the annual independent actuarial
study of the fund.  The surcharges for health care providers,
including hospitals and outpatient health care facilities whose
qualifications for the fund end on January 1, 2027, shall be
based on sound actuarial principles, using data obtained from
New Mexico claims and loss experience.  A hospital or
outpatient health care facility seeking participation in the
fund during the remaining qualifying years shall provide, at a
minimum, the hospital's or outpatient health care facility's
direct and indirect cost information as reported to the federal
centers for medicare and medicaid services for all self-insured
