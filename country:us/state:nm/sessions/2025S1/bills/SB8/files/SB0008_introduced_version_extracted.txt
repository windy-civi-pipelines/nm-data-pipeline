Money from the fund shall be expended only for the purposes of and to the extent provided in the Medical Malpractice Act. All approved expenses of collecting, protecting and administering the fund, including purchasing insurance for the fund, shall be paid from the fund. B. The superintendent shall contract for the administration and operation of the fund with a qualified, licensed third-party administrator, selected in consultation with the advisory board, no later than January 1, 2022. The third-party administrator shall provide an annual audit of the fund to the superintendent. C.

[D.] E. The superintendent shall levy an annual surcharge on all New Mexico health care providers qualifying under Section 41-5-5 NMSA 1978.

The surcharges for health care providers, including hospitals and outpatient health care facilities whose qualifications for the fund end on January 1, 2027, shall be based on sound actuarial principles, using data obtained from New Mexico claims and loss experience. A hospital or outpatient health care facility seeking participation in the fund during the remaining qualifying years shall provide, at a minimum, the hospital's or outpatient health care facility's direct and indirect cost information as reported to the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services for all self-insured malpractice claims, including claims and paid loss detail, and the claims and paid loss detail from any professional liability insurance carriers for each hospital or outpatient health care facility and each employed health care provider for the past eight years to the third-party actuary.

The superintendent, the third-party actuary or the advisory board shall not use or disclose the information for any purpose other than to fulfill the duties pursuant to this subsection. [E.] F. The surcharge shall be collected on the same basis as premiums by each insurer from the health care provider. The surcharge shall be due and payable within thirty days after the premiums for malpractice liability insurance have been received by the insurer from the health care provider in New Mexico. If the surcharge is collected but not paid timely, the superintendent may suspend the certificate of authority of the insurer until the annual premium surcharge is paid. [F.] G. Surcharges shall be set by October 31 of each year for the next calendar year. [Beginning in 2021, the surcharges shall be set with the intention of bringing the fund to solvency with no projected deficit by December 31, 2026.] All qualified and participating hospitals and outpatient health care facilities shall cure any fund deficit attributable to hospitals and outpatient health care facilities by December 31, 2026. [G.] H. If the fund would be exhausted by payment of all claims allowed during a particular calendar year, then the amounts paid to each patient and other parties obtaining judgments shall be prorated, with each such party receiving an amount equal to the percentage the party's own payment schedule bears to the total of payment schedules outstanding and payable by the fund. Any amounts due and unpaid as a result of such proration shall be paid in the following calendar years. [H.] I. Upon receipt of one of the proofs of authenticity listed in this subsection, reflecting a judgment for damages rendered pursuant to the Medical Malpractice Act, the superintendent shall issue or have issued warrants in accordance with the payment schedule constructed by the court and made a part of its final judgment. The only claim against the fund shall be a voucher or other appropriate request by the superintendent after the superintendent receives: (1) until January 1, 2022, a certified copy of a final judgment in excess of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) against a health care provider; (2) until January 1, 2022, a certified copy of a court-approved settlement or certification of settlement made prior to initiating suit, signed by both parties, in excess of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) against a health care provider; or (3) until January 1, 2022, a certified copy of a final judgment less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) and an affidavit of a health care provider or its insurer attesting that payments made pursuant to Subsection B of Section 41-5-7 NMSA 1978, combined with the monetary recovery, exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000). [I.] J. On or after January 1, 2022, the amounts specified in Paragraphs (1) through (3) of Subsection [H] I of this section shall be two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000)." SECTION 7. A new section of the Medical Malpractice Act is enacted to read: "[NEW MATERIAL] LIMITING ATTORNEY FEES.--An attorney shall not contract for or collect a contingency fee for representing a person seeking damages in a malpractice claim in an amount that exceeds: A. twenty-five percent of the dollar amount recovered, if the recovery is pursuant to a settlement agreement and release of all claims executed by all parties prior to the start of a trial or an arbitration proceeding; or B. thirty-three percent of the dollar amount recovered, if the recovery is pursuant to settlement, arbitration or judgment that occurs after a trial or arbitration proceeding begins." SECTION 8. A new section of the Medical Malpractice Act is enacted to read: "[NEW MATERIAL] PATIENT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT FUND--CREATED.-- A. The "patient safety improvement fund" is created in the state treasury and shall be administered by the department of health. The patient safety improvement fund consists of distributions, appropriations, gifts, grants and donations. Money in the patient safety improvement fund shall be invested by the state treasurer, and income from investment of the patient safety improvement fund shall be credited to the patient safety improvement fund. Money in the patient safety improvement fund shall be expended only as provided in this section. B. Money in the patient safety improvement fund is subject to appropriation by the legislature to the department of health for the purposes of improving patient safety and health care outcomes. All payments made from the patient safety improvement fund shall be made by warrant of the secretary of finance and administration pursuant to vouchers signed by the secretary of health or the secretary's authorized representative. Any unexpended or unencumbered balance remaining in the patient safety improvement fund at the end of a fiscal year shall not revert but shall remain to the credit of the patient safety improvement fund." - 24 -

The surcharge shall be due and payable within thirty days after the premiums for malpractice liability insurance have been received by the insurer from the health care provider in New Mexico. If the surcharge is collected but not paid timely, the superintendent may suspend the certificate of authority of the insurer until the annual premium surcharge is paid. [F.] G. Surcharges shall be set by October 31 of each year for the next calendar year. [Beginning in 2021, the surcharges shall be set with the intention of bringing the fund to solvency with no projected deficit by December 31, 2026.] All qualified and participating hospitals and outpatient health care facilities shall cure any fund deficit attributable to hospitals and outpatient health care facilities by December 31, 2026.

[I.] J. On or after January 1, 2022, the amounts specified in Paragraphs (1) through (3) of Subsection [H] I of this section shall be two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000)." SECTION 7.
